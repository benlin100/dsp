# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

My Answers:  

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

* show current working directory path = pwd = it prints the path of the working directory you're on  
* creating a directory = mkdir [directory name]: It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory  
* deleting a directory = rm -r [directory name]: Delets a directory and all of its children directories  
* creating a file using `touch` command = touch [file name]: takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory  
* deleting a file = rm [file name]: deletes the file from the filesystem  
* renaming a file = mv [file name1] [file name2]: renames a file; we rename the first file with the name we listed in the second file  
* listing hidden files = ls -a: command lists all files and directories in the working directory, including hidden files and directories  
* copying a file from one directory to another = mv [file name] [directory name]: moves the file into the directory  
* how to go back one path step = cd.. : moves back on step on your path  
* how to go one further on the path = cd [file/directory name] : allows you to enter more files and or directories

### Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

`ls`: lists all files and directories in the working directory.  
`ls -a` : The -a modifies the behavior of the ls command to also list the files and directories starting with a dot (.). Files started with a dot are hidden, and don't appear when using ls alone.  
`ls -l` : lists files and directories as a table with descriptions about each file/directory.  
`ls -lh`: list long format with readable file size  
`ls -lah`: list long format including hidden files & readable file size  
`ls -t` : sorts entries by time. By default, this option sorts the output by the modification times of files.  
`ls -Glp`: provides a detailed chart of each section of my Benjamin profile on my laptop

### Q3.  More List Files in Unix  

Explore these other [ls options](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php) and pick 5 of your favorites:

ls -c: Displays files by file timestamp.  
ls -d: Displays only dictionaries  
ls -r: displays files in reverse order  
ls -R: Displays subdirectories as well.  
ls -1: Displays each entry on a line

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

The xargs command in UNIX is a command line utility for building an execution pipeline from standard input. Using xargs allows tools like echo and rm and mkdir to accept standard input as arguments. xargs reads items from standard input as separated by blanks and executes a command once for each argument.

Here's an example:  
echo 'one two three' | xargs mkdir  
ls  
one two three
