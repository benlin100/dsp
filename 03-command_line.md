# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

* show current working directory path = pwd = it prints the path of the working directory you're on  
* creating a directory = mkdir [directory name]: It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory  
* deleting a directory = rm -r [directory name]: Delets a directory and all of its children directories  
* creating a file using `touch` command = touch [file name]: takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory  
* deleting a file = rm [file name]: deletes the file from the filesystem  
* renaming a file = mv [file name1] [file name2]: renames a file; we rename the first file with the name we listed in the second file  
* listing hidden files = ls -a: command lists all files and directories in the working directory, including hidden files and directories  
* copying a file from one directory to another = mv [file name] [directory name]: moves the file into the directory  
* how to go back one path step = cd.. : moves back on step on your path  
* how to go one further on the path = cd [file/directory name] : allows you to enter more files and or directories
